# Vision-Protector-Design-Based-on-Binocular-Parallex-Ranging-Algorithm

The innovation of this vision protector lies in relieving visual fatigue by using intelligent algorithm in computer vision instead of traditional ultrasonic ranging to measure the distance between users and books.  
It solves all problems of existing vision protectors perfectly (advantages include: non-contacting, accurate, high fault tolerance, convenient).  
The device appearance can be seen as follows. It contains a dual-camera, a LCD-screen and several buttons. It will give out a series of short beeps when it detects a possible unhealthy posture of reading (working, watching the screen or soon) and it will ï¬‚ash a LED to keep reminding users to adjust their postures.
