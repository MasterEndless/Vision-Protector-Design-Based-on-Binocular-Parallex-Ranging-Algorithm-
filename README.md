# Vision-Protector-Design-Based-on-Binocular-Parallex-Ranging-Algorithm

This vision protector uses intelligent algorithm in computer vision instead of traditional ultrasonic ranging to measure the distance between users and books.  
It solves all problems of existing vision protectors perfectly (advantages include: non-contacting, accurate, high fault tolerance, convenient). It contains a dual-camera, a LCD-screen and several buttons. It will give out a series of short beeps when it detects a possible unhealthy posture of reading (working, watching the screen or soon) and it will ï¬‚ash a LED to keep reminding users to adjust their postures.  
The device appearance, hardware architecture and software architecture can be seen in "Images" folder.  
 
The code execution needs the following environment:  
Linux ubuntu 14.04  
OpenCV 3.2  
Python 3.54  
Dlib 19.4
